### PR #16: Neo4j Container Management Implementation

#### What I Learned
- Blarify is a VS Code extension that creates 3D visualizations of code graphs using Neo4j
- The extension automatically manages Neo4j Docker containers for users
- Root issue was password mismatch between Neo4j containers and saved credentials
- VS Code configuration scopes: workspace vs global (application) scope is critical
- Docker volumes persist Neo4j authentication state and can cause conflicts
- Container manager has a bug in reuseExistingContainer method (tries provided password instead of container's actual password)

#### Architecture Patterns Discovered
- Event-driven container management with lifecycle hooks
- Layered architecture: Neo4jManager -> ContainerManager -> Docker API
- VS Code configuration management with global password persistence
- Comprehensive logging through output channels
- Volume and container cleanup to prevent authentication state conflicts

#### Security Considerations Noted
- Passwords stored in VS Code global configuration (encrypted by VS Code)
- Password generation uses secure random character selection
- No hardcoded credentials in codebase
- Container isolation prevents password leakage between environments

#### Performance Patterns
- Container reuse for efficiency (when working correctly)
- Dynamic port allocation to avoid conflicts
- Graceful shutdown handlers
- Health check polling with timeouts

#### Patterns to Watch
- Container manager's reuseExistingContainer bug needs fixing in future PR
- Complex container cleanup logic could be simplified
- Testing infrastructure needs Docker availability
- Memory.md pattern for tracking context across sessions
