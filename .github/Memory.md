  - Graph.get_nodes_by_label() takes enum objects, not strings
  - Relationship constructor takes Node objects, not IDs
  - DescriptionGenerator requires llm_service parameter
  - Fixed node_repr_for_identifier format for filesystem nodes

## Important Context
- **All workflow improvements completed successfully** (2025-08-01):
  - WorkflowMaster now has bulletproof state synchronization
  - Code review invocation is mandatory and verified
  - Memory files are preserved across all agent operations
  - Subagent permissions properly configured in settings.json
- **PR #28 (OrchestratorAgent)** is ready for final review and merge
  - All requested improvements implemented
  - Security enhancements added
  - Comprehensive documentation complete
- **CI/CD Fixed**: Updated GitHub Actions versions to resolve deprecation warnings:
  - actions/checkout@v3 → v4
  - actions/setup-python@v4 → v5  
  - actions/upload-artifact@v3 → v4
  - codecov/codecov-action@v3 → v4
- **Tree-sitter Issue**: Resolved by ensuring poetry environment is used correctly
- **Major API Fixes**:
  - Relationship constructor: `(start_node, end_node, rel_type)` not `source_id/target_id`
  - Graph API: No `.nodes` attribute, use `get_nodes_as_objects()`
  - Mock nodes require `node_repr_for_identifier` property
  - RelationshipType uses `DESCRIBES_ENTITY` not `DESCRIBES`
- All tests are now idempotent and use mocks for external dependencies
- Successfully resolved all API mismatches between tests and implementation
- Installed MCP dependencies (mcp 1.12.2) to enable MCP server tests
- Created pytest.ini configuration to handle path issues
- Some test files (code_complexity, documentation_extraction) hang and need investigation
- **Fixed remaining test failures (2025-07-31)**:
  - `test_filesystem_feature_missing.py` (3 tests): Updated to reflect that filesystem modules now exist
  - `test_filesystem_nodes_simple.py` (2 tests): Updated to test that node types exist rather than don't exist
  - `test_filesystem_operations.py` (10 tests): Fixed GitignoreManager API (uses constructor loading, not parse_gitignore method) and DefinitionNode constructor requirements
  - `test_llm_integration.py` (14 tests): Fixed LLMService API - generate_description() takes only prompt parameter, removed non-existent methods
- Key issues resolved:
  - Circular import between DefinitionNode and lsp_helper
  - Understanding that Graph uses enum objects as keys, not strings
  - Relationship constructor takes Node objects, not IDs
  - Many node constructors require specific parameters
- CI/CD pipeline ready but needs all tests to pass first

## Reflections
- Successfully improved coverage significantly despite implementation challenges
- Created solid test infrastructure that can be built upon
- Many tests work correctly once adapted to actual API
- Future improvements needed:
  - Fix remaining failing tests by matching exact API requirements
  - Add more integration tests
  - Consider refactoring some complex constructors
  - Add performance benchmarks
- The prompt file at `/prompts/improve-test-coverage.md` provides excellent guidance for future test improvements

## Next Steps
- Run full CI/CD pipeline to verify all tests pass in CI environment
- Add integration tests for complete workflows
- Run in CI/CD to verify cross-platform compatibility
- Target remaining low-coverage modules (documentation/* at 16-64%)
- Consider creating test documentation for future developers
