## Current Goals
- ✅ Implement transparent Neo4j container management for VS Code extension and MCP server
- ✅ Update both components to use the new neo4j-container-manager package

## Todo List
All tasks completed! 
- ✅ Create neo4j-container-manager package
- ✅ Update VS Code extension to use new manager  
- ✅ Update MCP server to use new manager

## Recent Accomplishments
1. **Created neo4j-container-manager package** - A comprehensive Node.js package that:
   - Manages Neo4j container lifecycle transparently
   - Allocates ports dynamically to avoid conflicts
   - Persists data across sessions using Docker volumes
   - Isolates test environments
   - Supports import/export functionality
   - Integrates with process lifecycle (containers stop when process exits)

2. **Updated VS Code extension** to use the new container manager:
   - Replaced 376 lines of Docker management code with simple manager calls
   - Fixed all packaging issues (dockerode now included correctly)
   - Tests all pass (11 passing tests)
   - Container starts automatically when extension activates

3. **Updated MCP server** to use the new container manager:
   - Created Python wrapper (neo4j_container.py) for the Node.js package
   - Added automatic container management settings to config
   - Updated documentation to highlight the new feature
   - Created container integration tests (5 passing tests)

## Important Context

### Key Architecture Decisions
1. **Shared npm package approach**: Created a single npm package that both VS Code extension (TypeScript) and MCP server (Python) can use. This ensures consistent behavior across both components.

2. **Python wrapper pattern**: Since MCP server is Python-based, created a wrapper that spawns Node.js processes to interact with the container manager. This avoids reimplementing the logic in Python.

3. **Dynamic port allocation**: Always finds free ports to avoid conflicts with existing Neo4j instances. Ports are allocated at runtime, not hardcoded.

4. **Data persistence strategy**: Uses Docker volumes tied to workspace/project directories to persist graph data across sessions while keeping different projects isolated.

### Technical Details
- **Package location**: `/Users/ryan/src/cue/neo4j-container-manager`
- **VS Code dependency**: Uses local file reference in package.json
- **MCP server wrapper**: Located at `mcp-blarify-server/src/neo4j_container.py`
- **Default data directory**: `.blarify/neo4j` in workspace root

### Fixed Issues
1. **VS Code extension activation**: Fixed by removing node_modules from .vscodeignore
2. **Container conflicts**: Resolved with dynamic port allocation
3. **Path resolution**: Fixed Blarify path search for both dev and installed scenarios
4. **Data persistence**: Implemented using Docker volumes per environment

## Reflections

### What Worked Well
- Creating a shared npm package was the right architectural choice
- Test-driven development helped catch issues early
- The Python wrapper pattern works reliably for cross-language integration
- Dynamic port allocation completely eliminates port conflicts

### Areas Improved
- Initially tried to manage containers directly in each component - centralized approach is much cleaner
- Learned that .vscodeignore can cause packaging issues by excluding dependencies
- Process lifecycle management (containers stopping when parent exits) prevents orphaned containers

### Next Steps (Future Improvements)
- Consider adding container health checks
- Add support for Neo4j Enterprise features
- Create CLI tool for manual container management
- Add metrics/monitoring capabilities
