## Current Phase Details
### Phase: Implementation
- **Status**: completed
- **Progress**: Built all core OrchestratorAgent components
- **Next Steps**: Begin Phase 6 - Testing comprehensive test suite
- **Blockers**: None

### Implementation Components Completed:
- **OrchestratorAgent Sub-Agent**: `.claude/agents/orchestrator-agent.md` - 500+ lines of comprehensive agent definition
- **TaskAnalyzer**: `.claude/orchestrator/components/task_analyzer.py` - Intelligent prompt parsing and dependency analysis
- **WorktreeManager**: `.claude/orchestrator/components/worktree_manager.py` - Git worktree lifecycle management
- **ExecutionEngine**: `.claude/orchestrator/components/execution_engine.py` - Parallel process execution with resource monitoring

### Research Findings:
- **Existing Infrastructure**: WorkflowMaster sub-agent at `.claude/agents/workflow-master.md` with robust state management
- **Sub-Agent Pattern**: Established pattern with code-reviewer, prompt-writer, and workflow-master agents
- **GitHub Integration**: Full GitHub CLI integration for issues, PRs, and workflow management
- **Test Coverage Opportunities**: Multiple modules need parallel test development (definition_node.py 32.09%, relationship_creator.py 32.50%, documentation_linker.py 15.65%)
- **Git Infrastructure**: Clean worktree support available, no existing worktrees currently active
- **Parallel Execution Strategy**: Claude CLI supports non-interactive mode with JSON output for monitoring

### Implementation Plan:
1. **TaskAnalyzer**: Parse prompts directory, detect file dependencies, classify parallelizable tasks
2. **WorktreeManager**: Create isolated git worktrees, manage branch strategies, handle cleanup
3. **ExecutionEngine**: Spawn multiple Claude CLI processes, monitor JSON output, handle resource throttling
4. **IntegrationManager**: Coordinate merges, resolve conflicts, aggregate results
5. **ReportingSystem**: Real-time progress monitoring, performance metrics, error reporting

## TodoWrite Task IDs
- Current task list IDs: Not yet created
- Completed tasks: Issue creation, branch creation
- In-progress task: None

## Resumption Instructions
1. Already on branch: `feature/orchestrator-agent-27`
2. Review completed work: Issue #27 created, OrchestratorAgent.md prompt committed
3. Continue from: Phase 4 - Research and Planning
4. Complete remaining phases: 4-9

## Error Recovery
- Last successful operation: Committed OrchestratorAgent.md prompt file
- Failed operation: WorkflowMaster was interrupted by user due to model switch
- Recovery steps: Resume from Phase 4 with enhanced interruption handling
