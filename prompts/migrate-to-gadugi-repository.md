# Migrate to Gadugi Repository - Agent Community Ecosystem

## Title and Overview

This prompt guides the creation of "gadugi" - a centralized repository for reusable Claude Code agents and instructions, implementing the Cherokee concept of communal work and collective wisdom. Gadugi will serve as the foundation for a distributed ecosystem of AI-powered development tools that can be shared across projects.

The migration will establish gadugi as the canonical source for generic agents while preserving project-specific customizations in individual repositories. This creates a sustainable model for agent development, maintenance, and distribution across the Claude Code community.

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations
- **Fragmented Agent Ecosystem**: Each project maintains its own copies of common agents (workflow-master, code-reviewer, prompt-writer), leading to duplication and version drift
- **No Centralized Updates**: Bug fixes and improvements to agents require manual propagation across projects
- **Discovery Challenges**: Developers cannot easily find and leverage existing agents created by the community
- **Version Management**: No systematic way to track agent versions, updates, or rollback capabilities
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Each project maintainer must independently update and maintain common agents

### Cherokee Concept of Gadugi
Gadugi (pronounced gah-DOO-gee) is a Cherokee concept representing:
- **Communal Work**: Community members coming together to accomplish tasks that benefit everyone
- **Collective Wisdom**: Sharing knowledge and expertise for the greater good
- **Mutual Support**: Helping others with the understanding that the community thrives together
- **Shared Resources**: Pooling tools and knowledge for more efficient outcomes

This philosophy aligns perfectly with a shared agent repository where the community contributes, maintains, and benefits from collective AI-powered development tools.

### Impact on Development Workflow
- Faster project setup with proven, battle-tested agents
- Consistent quality and behavior across projects
- Reduced maintenance burden for individual developers
- Community-driven improvements and innovations
- Scalable model for agent ecosystem growth

## Feature Requirements

### 1. Repository Creation and Structure
- **GitHub Repository**: Create "gadugi" repository with comprehensive README explaining Cherokee concept
- **MIT License**: Use permissive licensing to encourage adoption and contribution
- **Directory Structure**: Organized layout for agents, instructions, templates, and examples
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Usage guides, contribution guidelines, integration patterns

### 2. Agent Migration Strategy
- **Generic Agent Identification**: Migrate universally applicable agents to gadugi
- **Project-Specific Preservation**: Keep project-specific agents in original repositories
- **Version Management**: Implement semantic versioning for agents and instructions
- **Dependency Mapping**: Document agent dependencies and compatibility requirements

### 3. Integration Architecture
- **Agent Manager Integration**: Leverage existing agent-manager for repository synchronization
- **Import Pattern**: Use Claude Code @ syntax for seamless integration
- **Auto-Update Mechanism**: Optional automatic updates with configurable policies
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful degradation when gadugi is unavailable

### 4. Community Ecosystem Features
- **Contribution Workflow**: Standard process for community contributions
- **Quality Assurance**: Testing and validation framework for submitted agents
- **Documentation Standards**: Consistent format for agent documentation
- **Example Integration**: Templates showing how to integrate gadugi with projects
