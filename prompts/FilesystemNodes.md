We have forked a program called Blarify that uses tree-sitter and language server protocol servers to create a graph of a codebase AST and its bindings to symbols. This is a powerful tool for understanding code structure and relationships.  Analyze this code base and remember its structure so that you can make plans about the new features we will add. 

We are going to add a new feature to this code - for every node created in the graph, we will also add a related node (connected by an edge) that describes the node's location in the filesystem layout of the codebase. This should happen *after* the AST+symbol bindings nodes are created, and then the filesystem nodes shall be connected with edges to the relevant code nodes (edge types based upon which file implements the code or depends upon it). If a file path is referenced by the LLM summary of a code node then we also should create an edge reference between that summary and the filesystem node. 

You will need to use neo4j in a docker container to store the graph data. This should be the same as the one used for the [LLM description generation feature](./LLMSummaries.md). 
You will need to build up tests for this feature and may need to bootstrap testing for the project in general. The tests should manage their dependencies (eg neo4j) and should do so idempotently, not touching the dev database or volumes. 

Think carefully about the best way to add this filesystem nodes generation feature. If additional extensibility is required to make it clean, then investigate that. Once you have a good plan, please create an issue in the issues database of the remote repo (https://github.com/rysweet/cue) to descibe the feature and record your plan, step by step. Your plan should include writing a failing test for the feature first, then enabling the test to pass by implementing the feature. please also include in the issue a description of how the filesystem nodes will be created, what properties they will have, and how they will be connected to the code nodes.  

Once the issue is created, then you may please create a new branch in the remote for the issue and switch to it, and then proceed to divide the work into clear steps and allocate it as needed to implement by yourself or dedicated subagents as needed.
Once the work is planned, proceed to implement it thinking carefully and step by step, committing changes to the branch as you go. 
Once the work is complete, please create a pull request on https://github.com/rysweet/cue to merge the branch into main, and then review it carefully before merging.
