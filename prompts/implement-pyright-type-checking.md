# Implement Comprehensive Pyright Type Checking and Fix All Type Errors

## Title and Overview

**Feature**: Comprehensive Pyright Type Checking Implementation for Blarify Codebase

This prompt guides the implementation of strict pyright type checking across the entire Blarify Python codebase. Blarify is a codebase analysis tool that uses tree-sitter and Language Server Protocol (LSP) servers to create a graph of a codebase's AST and symbol bindings. The project includes a Python backend with Neo4j/FalkorDB graph databases, tree-sitter parsing support for multiple languages, LSP integration for symbol resolution, LLM integration for code descriptions, and comprehensive testing infrastructure.

The goal is to achieve 100% pyright compliance with strict type checking enabled, ensuring type safety across all Python modules while maintaining code quality and preventing runtime type errors.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Type Safety Issues

The Blarify codebase currently lacks comprehensive static type checking enforcement, leading to several challenges:

1. **Inconsistent Type Annotations**: While some modules use `typing.TYPE_CHECKING` imports and basic type hints, many functions and methods lack proper type annotations
2. **Missing Type Safety Enforcement**: The current CI pipeline runs `mypy` with `--ignore-missing-imports` and allows failures (`|| true`), providing no enforcement
3. **Runtime Type Errors**: Without strict type checking, type-related bugs can slip through to production
4. **Developer Experience**: IDE support and code completion are limited without comprehensive type information
5. **Maintenance Burden**: Refactoring is more error-prone without static type guarantees

### Current Implementation State

Analysis of the codebase reveals:
- **Basic Type Hints**: Some functions have type annotations (e.g., `main.py` functions use basic parameter types)
- **TYPE_CHECKING Imports**: Many modules use `from typing import TYPE_CHECKING` pattern for circular import avoidance
- **Mixed Type Coverage**: Some modules like `graph.py` have good type annotations while others lack them entirely
- **CI Integration**: MyPy is configured but not enforced (`poetry run mypy cue/ --ignore-missing-imports || true`)

### Impact on Development

Without strict type checking:
- **Bug Detection**: Type-related errors only discovered at runtime
- **Refactoring Risk**: Large-scale changes are error-prone without type safety
- **Code Quality**: Inconsistent patterns across the codebase
- **Team Productivity**: Developers spend time debugging type-related issues that could be caught statically

### Proposed Technical Approach

#### Phase 1: Foundation Setup

     "exclude": ["**/node_modules", "**/__pycache__", "dist", "build"],
     "typeCheckingMode": "strict",
     "reportMissingImports": true,
     "reportMissingTypeStubs": false,
     "pythonVersion": "3.12",
     "pythonPlatform": "Linux"
   }
   ```

2. **Update pyproject.toml**
   ```toml
   [tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
   pyright = "^1.1.350"
   
   [tool.pyright]
   include = ["cue", "tests"]
   exclude = ["**/node_modules", "**/__pycache__"]
   typeCheckingMode = "strict"
   reportMissingImports = true
   pythonVersion = "3.12"
   ```

#### Step 11: Code Review Process
1. **Automated Checks**
   - Ensure all CI/CD checks pass including new type checking
   - Validate test coverage meets requirements
   - Confirm performance benchmarks are within targets
   - Verify documentation builds successfully

2. **Manual Review**
   - Invoke code-reviewer sub-agent for comprehensive review
   - Address any feedback on type annotation quality
   - Resolve any suggestions for type safety improvements
   - Ensure type checking patterns follow established conventions

3. **Review Response**
   - Use CodeReviewResponseAgent if review feedback requires changes
   - Implement requested improvements systematically
   - Update documentation based on review suggestions
   - Ensure all reviewer concerns are addressed

#### Step 12: Final Integration
1. **Pre-merge Validation**
   - Final test suite run with all changes
   - Validate type checking performance one final time
   - Confirm all documentation is up to date
   - Ensure branch is up to date with main

2. **Merge Process**
   - Merge PR after all approvals received
   - Monitor CI/CD pipeline after merge
   - Validate that main branch type checking works correctly
   - Update any dependent branches or PRs

3. **Post-merge Follow-up**
   - Update Memory.md with implementation success
   - Monitor for any issues in subsequent development
   - Gather developer feedback on new type checking workflow
   - Plan any additional type safety improvements
