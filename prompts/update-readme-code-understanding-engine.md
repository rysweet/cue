# Update README for Code Understanding Engine

## Objective
Transform the current README to properly describe this system as a "Code Understanding Engine" (CUE) - a sophisticated tool that leverages multilayer graph analysis, MCP services, and interactive visualization to enhance AI agents' comprehension of large codebases.

## Background
The current README likely focuses on the AI-SIP workshop context, but the system has evolved into a powerful code analysis platform that helps AI agents better understand complex codebases through:
- Multilayer graph representation of code relationships
