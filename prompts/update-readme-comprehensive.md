# Update README for Cue Repository

## Context
The Cue repository has evolved significantly and now includes:
- A multilayer code understanding graph
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration  
- VS Code extension (Blarify visualizer)
- Comprehensive code analysis and visualization capabilities

The current README doesn't reflect these latest features and needs a comprehensive update.

## Task
Create a new README.md that accurately reflects the current state of the project, including:

### 1. Project Overview
- Clear description of what Cue/Blarify is
- Core value proposition for developers
- Key features and capabilities

### 2. Architecture Overview
- Multilayer code understanding graph
- How different components work together
- Visual diagram if possible

### 3. Components
- **Blarify Core**: Code analysis engine
- **MCP Server**: Model Context Protocol integration
- **VS Code Extension**: Interactive visualization
- **Graph Database**: Neo4j integration

### 4. Installation & Setup
- Prerequisites (Python, Neo4j, VS Code)
- Step-by-step installation guide
- Configuration options

### 5. Usage
- Basic usage examples
- VS Code extension usage
- MCP server usage
- API examples

### 6. Features Deep Dive
- Code understanding capabilities
- Graph visualization
- Language support
- Integration with AI models

### 7. Development
- Contributing guidelines
- Architecture details
- Testing approach
- CI/CD pipeline

### 8. Troubleshooting
- Common issues and solutions
- Debug mode
- FAQ

## Implementation Steps
1. Analyze current codebase structure
2. Review existing documentation
3. Examine VS Code extension features
4. Review MCP server implementation
5. Draft comprehensive new README
6. Include code examples and usage scenarios
7. Add screenshots/diagrams where helpful

## Success Criteria
- README accurately reflects all current features
- Clear installation and usage instructions
- Professional documentation that helps users quickly understand and use the project
- Follows modern README best practices
