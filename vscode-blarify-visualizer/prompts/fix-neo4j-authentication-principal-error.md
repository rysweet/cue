# Fix Neo4j Authentication "Missing Key Principal" Error

## Title and Overview

**Fix Neo4j Authentication Format Compatibility for VS Code Extension**

This prompt addresses the critical Neo4j authentication error "missing key `principal`" that occurs when the Blarify VS Code extension attempts to connect to Neo4j databases. This error typically indicates a version mismatch between the Neo4j Python driver authentication format and the authentication expectations of Neo4j 5.x servers.

Blarify is a codebase analysis tool that creates interactive 3D visualizations of code structure using Neo4j as the graph database backend. The VS Code extension integrates with both local Docker containers and remote Neo4j instances, requiring robust authentication handling across different Neo4j versions.

## Problem Statement

### Current Issue
The VS Code extension is experiencing authentication failures with the error message "missing key `principal`" when connecting to Neo4j databases. This error manifests in several scenarios:

1. **Docker Container Authentication**: Local Neo4j containers fail to authenticate with the Python driver
2. **Remote Neo4j Connections**: Connections to external Neo4j 5.x instances fail with authentication format errors
3. **Extension Activation Failures**: The extension fails to activate properly due to database connection issues
4. **Inconsistent Authentication Behavior**: Authentication works intermittently depending on Neo4j version and configuration

### Root Cause Analysis
The error "missing key `principal`" indicates that:
- The Neo4j Python driver is using an outdated authentication format
- Neo4j 5.x servers expect authentication tokens in a different format than previous versions
- The authentication tuple format `(username, password)` may need to be replaced with proper authentication tokens
- Driver version compatibility issues between the Python neo4j driver and Neo4j 5.x server versions

### Impact Assessment
- **User Experience**: Extension fails to load or connect to databases
- **Development Workflow**: Developers cannot visualize codebases using the extension
- **Production Deployments**: Enterprise users cannot connect to their Neo4j infrastructure
- **Extension Adoption**: Authentication issues prevent new users from successfully using the extension

### Current Implementation
The current authentication is implemented in `/bundled/blarify/db_managers/neo4j_manager.py`:
```python
self.driver = GraphDatabase.driver(uri, auth=(user, password), max_connection_pool_size=max_connections)
```

This basic tuple format may be incompatible with Neo4j 5.x authentication requirements.

## Technical Analysis

### Current Implementation Review

The current Neo4j authentication implementation has several limitations:

**In `/bundled/pyproject.toml`:**
- Uses `neo4j = "^5.25.0"` which should be compatible with Neo4j 5.x
- Driver version appears current and appropriate

**In `/bundled/blarify/db_managers/neo4j_manager.py`:**
- Uses basic tuple authentication: `auth=(user, password)`
- No specific authentication token handling
- Limited error handling for authentication failures
- No version-specific authentication logic

**Current Strengths:**
- Proper retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Environment variable configuration support
- Connection pooling configuration
- Basic error handling structure

**Current Weaknesses:**
- No Neo4j 5.x specific authentication token usage
- Limited authentication error diagnostics
- No fallback authentication methods
- Minimal authentication validation

### Proposed Technical Approach

1. **Authentication Token Implementation**
   - Replace tuple authentication with proper token-based authentication
   - Use `neo4j.basic_auth()` function for Neo4j 5.x compatibility
   - Implement authentication scheme detection and selection
   - Add support for custom authentication methods

2. **Driver Configuration Enhancement**
   - Update driver initialization with proper authentication tokens
   - Add connection verification and health checks
   - Implement driver-specific error handling
   - Add configuration validation for authentication parameters

3. **Version Detection and Compatibility**
   - Detect Neo4j server version during connection
   - Use version-appropriate authentication methods
   - Provide compatibility layers for different versions
   - Handle authentication format migrations

4. **Error Handling and Diagnostics**
   - Specific error detection for "missing key principal" errors
   - Detailed logging for authentication troubleshooting
   - User-friendly error messages with resolution guidance
   - Diagnostic utilities for authentication issues

### Architecture and Design Decisions

1. **Backward Compatibility Strategy**
   - Maintain support for existing configurations
   - Graceful degradation for older Neo4j versions
