## Current Goals
- Fix Neo4j startup issues in VS Code extension ✓
- Ensure Neo4j container starts reliably with correct authentication ✓
- Fix password persistence for container reuse ✓
- Document troubleshooting workflow ✓

## Todo List
- [x] Fix container manager password mismatch in reuseExistingContainer
- [x] Test simplified Neo4j startup logic
- [x] Debug why container removal is not working in ensureRunning
- [x] Test improved logic that tries saved password first
- [x] Fix password persistence to use Global scope instead of Workspace
- [x] Test password persistence with application scope
- [x] Debug why VS Code window shows timeout despite container running
- [x] Remove Neo4j volumes when removing containers to prevent auth issues
- [x] Document VS Code extension troubleshooting workflow
- [x] Test and commit all fixes
- [ ] Fix container manager's list() method to return actual Docker containers (future improvement)

## Recent Accomplishments
- Successfully fixed all Neo4j startup issues
- Implemented comprehensive container and volume cleanup
- Fixed password persistence to work globally across VS Code windows
- Created detailed troubleshooting documentation
- All tests passing, Neo4j starts reliably in ~15-20 seconds
- Committed all changes with comprehensive commit message

## Important Context
- Root cause: Containers were reusing volumes with different passwords
- Solution: Remove both containers AND volumes during cleanup
- Password persistence fixed by changing scope from "resource" to "application"
- VS Code stores logs in ~/Library/Application Support/Code - Insiders/logs/
- Extension output channels provide detailed debugging information

## Current Status
- ✅ Neo4j starts successfully in all test scenarios
- ✅ Passwords persist globally in settings.json
- ✅ No more timeout errors
- ✅ Comprehensive logging implemented
- ✅ All changes tested and committed

## Reflections
- Always check Docker volumes when debugging container authentication issues
- VS Code configuration scopes are critical for cross-window functionality
- Comprehensive logging is essential for debugging extension issues
- Test scripts that create isolated environments are invaluable
- The troubleshooting workflow documentation will help future debugging
