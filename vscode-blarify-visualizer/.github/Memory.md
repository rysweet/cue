## Current Goals
- Fix Neo4j startup issues in VS Code extension ✓
- Ensure Neo4j container starts reliably with correct authentication ✓
- Fix password persistence for container reuse ✓
- Document troubleshooting workflow ✓
- Create comprehensive pre-commit workflow prompt for multi-language repository ✓

## Todo List
- [x] Fix container manager password mismatch in reuseExistingContainer
- [x] Test simplified Neo4j startup logic
- [x] Debug why container removal is not working in ensureRunning
- [x] Test improved logic that tries saved password first
- [x] Fix password persistence to use Global scope instead of Workspace
- [x] Test password persistence with application scope
- [x] Debug why VS Code window shows timeout despite container running
- [x] Remove Neo4j volumes when removing containers to prevent auth issues
- [x] Document VS Code extension troubleshooting workflow
- [x] Test and commit all fixes
- [x] Create comprehensive multi-language pre-commit workflow prompt
- [ ] Fix container manager's list() method to return actual Docker containers (future improvement)

## Recent Accomplishments
- Successfully fixed all Neo4j startup issues
- Implemented comprehensive container and volume cleanup
- Fixed password persistence to work globally across VS Code windows
- Created detailed troubleshooting documentation
- All tests passing, Neo4j starts reliably in ~15-20 seconds
- Committed all changes with comprehensive commit message
- **NEW**: Created comprehensive multi-language pre-commit workflow prompt for TypeScript/Python hybrid repository

## Important Context
- Root cause: Containers were reusing volumes with different passwords
- Solution: Remove both containers AND volumes during cleanup
- Password persistence fixed by changing scope from "resource" to "application"
- VS Code stores logs in ~/Library/Application Support/Code - Insiders/logs/
- Extension output channels provide detailed debugging information
- **Repository Structure**: Contains both TypeScript VS Code extension (`/src/`) and Python Blarify engine (`/bundled/blarify/` with Poetry)
- **Multi-language Tooling**: Python uses Poetry, Ruff, Black, mypy; TypeScript uses npm, ESLint, Prettier

## Current Status
- ✅ Neo4j starts successfully in all test scenarios
- ✅ Passwords persist globally in settings.json
- ✅ No more timeout errors
- ✅ Comprehensive logging implemented
- ✅ All changes tested and committed
- ✅ **Multi-language pre-commit workflow prompt completed and saved**

## Reflections
- Always check Docker volumes when debugging container authentication issues
- VS Code configuration scopes are critical for cross-window functionality
- Comprehensive logging is essential for debugging extension issues
- Test scripts that create isolated environments are invaluable
- The troubleshooting workflow documentation will help future debugging
- **Multi-language repositories require sophisticated pre-commit workflows**: Need to handle both TypeScript and Python toolchains with parallel processing, smart file detection, and cross-language validation

## Code Review Session - 2025-08-01T16:30:00Z

### PR #16 Code Review Completed
- ✅ Conducted comprehensive code review of Neo4j container management implementation  
- ✅ Identified critical security issue: weak password generation using Math.random()
- ✅ Identified performance improvements: refactor long ensureRunning method
- ✅ Documented findings in CodeReviewerProjectMemory.md
- ✅ Posted detailed review feedback on GitHub PR #16

### Key Findings
- **Security Critical**: Password generation needs crypto.randomBytes() instead of Math.random()
- **Architecture**: Good separation of concerns, pragmatic workaround for container manager bug
- **Testing**: Integration tests skipped due to underlying container manager issues
- **Documentation**: Excellent troubleshooting documentation created

## Code Review Response Implementation - 2025-08-01T19:48:00Z

### PR #16 Code Review Feedback Addressed
- ✅ **Security Issue Fixed**: Replaced Math.random() with crypto.randomBytes() in generatePassword() method
- ✅ **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling for password operations
  - Password retrieval with validation and fallback
  - Password saving with error recovery
  - Password clearing with safe deletion
- ✅ **Container Age Monitoring**: Added container age calculation and warnings for containers older than 7 days
- ✅ **Improved Logging**: Enhanced logging throughout neo4jManager.ts and configurationManager.ts
  - Detailed startup timing information
  - Password operation status logging
  - Better error context and stack traces
  - Clear warnings for potential issues

### Technical Improvements Made
1. **Security Enhancement**: Cryptographically secure password generation with fallback
2. **Robust Error Handling**: All password operations now have proper error handling and recovery
3. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Container age tracking with performance recommendations
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed operational logging for better debugging
5. **Input Validation**: Added validation for all password-related operations

### Code Quality Metrics
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ All existing tests pass
- ✅ Enhanced error boundaries prevent cascading failures
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility

### Files Modified
- `/src/neo4jManager.ts`: Enhanced with robust error handling, container age checks, and improved logging
- `/src/configurationManager.ts`: Added comprehensive error handling for all password operations

## Multi-Language Pre-commit Workflow Prompt Creation - 2025-08-01T22:45:00Z

### Comprehensive Prompt Completed
- ✅ **Multi-Language Analysis**: Analyzed both TypeScript (VS Code extension) and Python (Blarify engine) components
- ✅ **Hybrid Repository Architecture**: Documented TypeScript in `/src/` and Python in `/bundled/blarify/` with Poetry
- ✅ **Tool Integration Strategy**: Designed parallel processing for TypeScript (Prettier, ESLint, tsc) and Python (Black, Ruff, isort, mypy, pytest)
- ✅ **Performance Optimization**: Targeted execution times: TypeScript <15s, Python <20s, Mixed <30s
- ✅ **Cross-Language Validation**: API compatibility checks between TypeScript extension and Python engine
- ✅ **Emergency Procedures**: Unified bypass mechanism with comprehensive audit trail

### Key Features of the Prompt
1. **Sophisticated Architecture**: Pre-commit framework with smart file detection and language-specific pipelines
2. **Tool Configuration**: 
   - TypeScript: Prettier, ESLint auto-fixing, incremental compilation, VS Code extension build validation
   - Python: Black formatting (120 char), Ruff linting, isort imports, mypy type checking, pytest selective execution
3. **Performance-First Design**: Parallel execution, incremental processing, tool caching optimization
4. **Developer Experience**: Unified workflow, clear error messages, comprehensive documentation, IDE integration
5. **Quality Assurance**: 100% formatting consistency, zero linting errors, compilation success validation

### Technical Implementation Plan
- **Phase 1**: Multi-language infrastructure foundation (Week 1)
- **Phase 2**: TypeScript quality pipeline (Week 2)  
- **Phase 3**: Python quality pipeline (Week 3)
- **Phase 4**: Cross-language integration (Week 4)
- **Phase 5**: Developer experience and documentation (Week 5)

### Documentation Delivered
- **Comprehensive Workflow Guide**: Multi-language usage, troubleshooting, advanced features
- **Developer Onboarding**: Step-by-step setup checklist for hybrid development environment
- **Implementation Steps**: Detailed GitHub workflow from issue creation to PR deployment
- **Testing Strategy**: Multi-language scenarios, performance validation, edge case handling

### File Created
- `/prompts/implement-precommit-workflow.md`: 1,815 lines of comprehensive implementation guidance
- Covers complete workflow from requirements gathering to deployment and monitoring
- Includes specific configurations for both TypeScript and Python toolchains
- Ready for WorkflowMaster execution or manual implementation
