- âœ… Document troubleshooting workflow (COMPLETED)
- âœ… Implement comprehensive multi-language pre-commit workflow (COMPLETED)
- ðŸ”„ Fix Neo4j Authentication "Missing Key Principal" Error for 5.x Compatibility (IN PROGRESS - Issue #56)

## Todo List
- [x] Fix container manager password mismatch in reuseExistingContainer
- [x] Test simplified Neo4j startup logic
- [x] Debug why container removal is not working in ensureRunning
- [x] Test improved logic that tries saved password first
- [x] Fix password persistence to use Global scope instead of Workspace
- [x] Test password persistence with application scope
- [x] Debug why VS Code window shows timeout despite container running
- [x] Remove Neo4j volumes when removing containers to prevent auth issues
- [x] Document VS Code extension troubleshooting workflow
- [x] Test and commit all fixes
- [ ] Fix container manager's list() method to return actual Docker containers (future improvement)

## Recent Accomplishments
- Successfully fixed all Neo4j startup issues
- Implemented comprehensive container and volume cleanup
- Fixed password persistence to work globally across VS Code windows
- Created detailed troubleshooting documentation
- All tests passing, Neo4j starts reliably in ~15-20 seconds
- Committed all changes with comprehensive commit message

## Important Context
- Root cause: Containers were reusing volumes with different passwords
- Solution: Remove both containers AND volumes during cleanup
- Password persistence fixed by changing scope from "resource" to "application"
- VS Code stores logs in ~/Library/Application Support/Code - Insiders/logs/
- Extension output channels provide detailed debugging information

## Current Status
- âœ… Neo4j starts successfully in all test scenarios
- âœ… Passwords persist globally in settings.json
- âœ… No more timeout errors
- âœ… Comprehensive logging implemented
- âœ… All changes tested and committed

## Reflections
- Always check Docker volumes when debugging container authentication issues
- VS Code configuration scopes are critical for cross-window functionality
- Comprehensive logging is essential for debugging extension issues
- Test scripts that create isolated environments are invaluable
- The troubleshooting workflow documentation will help future debugging

## Neo4j Authentication Fix Research - 2025-08-01T15:30:00Z

### Issue #56: Neo4j Authentication "Missing Key Principal" Error Analysis
- **Root Cause Identified**: Python neo4j_manager.py uses tuple format `auth=(user, password)` which is incompatible with Neo4j 5.x
- **Current Implementation**: Line 35 in `/bundled/blarify/db_managers/neo4j_manager.py` uses deprecated authentication format
- **Neo4j Driver Version**: Already compatible at `^5.25.0` in pyproject.toml - no driver upgrade needed
- **Compatibility Requirements**: Must maintain backward compatibility with Neo4j 4.x while adding 5.x support

### Technical Analysis Complete
- **Primary File**: `/bundled/blarify/db_managers/neo4j_manager.py` requires authentication method update
- **Container Integration**: VS Code TypeScript manager (`/src/neo4jManager.ts`) handles Docker containers, Python handles authentication
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Limited existing tests for authentication scenarios - comprehensive test suite needed
- **Docker Integration**: Container manager in `/bundled/neo4j-container-manager/` may need credential passing updates

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Replace tuple authentication** with `neo4j.basic_auth(user, password)` function call
2. **Add authentication scheme detection** and fallback mechanisms
3. **Implement comprehensive error handling** for "missing key principal" specific errors
4. **Create test suite** covering Neo4j 4.x and 5.x authentication scenarios
5. **Update Docker integration** to ensure consistent authentication format
6. **Add migration utilities** for existing user configurations
