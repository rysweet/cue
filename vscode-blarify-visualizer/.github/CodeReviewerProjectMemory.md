### PR #16: Neo4j Container Management Implementation

#### What I Learned
- Blarify is a VS Code extension that creates 3D visualizations of code graphs using Neo4j
- The extension automatically manages Neo4j Docker containers for users
- Root issue was password mismatch between Neo4j containers and saved credentials
- VS Code configuration scopes: workspace vs global (application) scope is critical
- Docker volumes persist Neo4j authentication state and can cause conflicts
- Container manager has a bug in reuseExistingContainer method (tries provided password instead of container's actual password)

#### Architecture Patterns Discovered
- Event-driven container management with lifecycle hooks
- Layered architecture: Neo4jManager -> ContainerManager -> Docker API
- VS Code configuration management with global password persistence
- Comprehensive logging through output channels
- Volume and container cleanup to prevent authentication state conflicts

#### Security Considerations Noted
- Passwords stored in VS Code global configuration (encrypted by VS Code)
- Password generation uses secure random character selection
- No hardcoded credentials in codebase
- Container isolation prevents password leakage between environments

#### Performance Patterns
- Container reuse for efficiency (when working correctly)
- Dynamic port allocation to avoid conflicts
- Graceful shutdown handlers
- Health check polling with timeouts

#### Patterns to Watch
- Container manager's reuseExistingContainer bug needs fixing in future PR
- Complex container cleanup logic could be simplified
- Testing infrastructure needs Docker availability
- Memory.md pattern for tracking context across sessions

### PR #57: Neo4j 5.x Authentication Compatibility Fix

#### What I Learned
- Neo4j 5.x requires `neo4j.basic_auth(user, password)` instead of tuple format `(user, password)`
- "Missing key principal" error is specific to Neo4j 5.x authentication format incompatibility
- Blarify uses Python Neo4j driver 5.25.0 which supports both authentication methods
- Authentication verification with simple test queries prevents silent failures
- Fallback mechanisms can maintain backward compatibility while adopting new patterns

#### Architecture Patterns Discovered
- Multi-stage authentication with primary/fallback strategies
- Proactive authentication verification to catch issues early
- Comprehensive health checking with diagnostics and server info collection
- Exponential backoff retry pattern for connection resilience
- Extensive logging for authentication troubleshooting

#### Security Considerations Noted
- Error message sanitization needed to prevent credential exposure in logs
- Authentication tuple fallback could be a security risk if not properly handled
- Connection pool management during authentication failures requires careful cleanup
- Health check write operations should be optional to avoid unnecessary database modifications

#### Performance Patterns
- Connection retry with exponential backoff (2^attempt seconds)
- Authentication verification using lightweight test queries
- Server info caching potential for repeated diagnostic calls
- Health check optimization by making write operations configurable

#### Patterns to Watch
- Deep error handling nesting could be refactored into separate methods
- Authentication strategy selection could be configurable rather than automatic
- Test coverage gaps for authentication scenarios need comprehensive test suite
- Error message sanitization should be standardized across all authentication code

#### Key Implementation Insights
- Primary authentication uses `basic_auth()` for Neo4j 5.x compatibility
- Fallback to tuple format maintains Neo4j 4.x support
- Authentication verification prevents silent connection failures
- Health checks provide comprehensive diagnostics for troubleshooting
- Logging strategy balances verbosity with security (needs sanitization improvement)
